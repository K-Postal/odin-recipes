        <h1>Eggplant Pasta</h1>
        <p>This recipe for Eggplant Pasta has been in my rotation for a while now. It is a great
            recipe for those nights where you don't know what you want to make. It is a quick dish that never dissapoints.
        </p>
        <p>It is traditionally fried in oil but you do have a choice of baking it as well. This recipe is for the baked version
            but if the fried version sounds better I will be posting that one at a later date too. 
        </p>

            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
            <li>1/2 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>700g / 24 oz tomato passata</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried Italian herbs</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>300g / 10oz spaghetti or other pasta, long or short</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h2>Roasted Eggplant:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line a tray with baking / parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Toss eggplant with oil, salt and pepper. Spread on the tray and roast for 
                20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip, then roast for a further 5 minutes. Cool on tray(this helps the eggplant
                hold its shape when tossing).
            </li>
            <li>In a large pot bring pasta to a boil. Make sure to salt the water like the sea. Cook
                until al dente.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Sauce:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, cook for 20 seconds until
                golden, then add onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high and add wine, if using. Let it simmer, scraping the base of the pan
                to deglaze, until wine mostly evaporates.
            </li>
            <li>Add tomato passata. Now pour the water into the passata bottle and shake to get the rest of it.</li>
            <li>Add dried herbs, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Stir and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in eggplant, then add cooked and drained pasta. Gently toss until pasta is coated in the sauce</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with a good pinch of fresh basil and parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
